<h1>How to use this application</h1>

<p>
Type a crossword clue into the text box provided.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
Specify the number of words in the solution by hitting up or down on the spinner. For each word in the solution, type the number of 
letters in that word into the input box provided.
<br/>
</p>

<p>
<br/>
If the clue is a Fill-In-The-Blank clue, where the solution constitutes a missing section of the clue text, indicate any blank words in
the clue text using an underscore (_) for each one.
<br/>
For example: <i>Nat _ Cole</i>
</p>

<p>
<br/>
Clues will be solved more quickly if names that consist of multiple words are surrounded by double-quotes.
<br/>
For example, <i>"The Dark Side of the Moon" band</i> will be solved more quickly than <i>The Dark Side of the Moon band</i>. However, phrases 
surrounded by quotes will be treated as being case-sensitive.
